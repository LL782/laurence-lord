The repo is at [github.com/LL782/mundoko-maps/](https://github.com/LL782/mundoko-maps/) but that's not where I was at when I left off.

Funny, I'm structuring these notes with, Done, Doing, To Do. Why not just create issues and a project in the repo? I guess it's because I also have more general notes. Let's review this later though, will I/did I add any notes that couldn't have been attached directly to specific issues?

## Done

- [x] Created [a Contentful space](https://app.contentful.com/spaces/zy8ufabt1tm0/)
- [x] Drafted [the model for a Map Tile content type](https://app.contentful.com/spaces/zy8ufabt1tm0/content_types/mapTile/fields)
- [x] Decided to use the coordinates of the centre of each tile, along with the scale, and a fixed tile size to pin-point each tile. Previously I was using a pair of coordinates to describe the top-left and bottom-right corners of each tile.

  - e.g. before `5140000,5150000x5150000,5160000` after `5145000,5155000`
  - I now have tile titles like, `--e-5145--s-5155--city--topo` or `--e-{east}--s-{south}--{scale}--{type}`
  - ðŸ‘†_Still not convinced with that file name format_

- [x] Learned that in Contentful each `asset` has a `file` field that can be changed, leaving the asset ID, title and description in place
  - So given a tile's image is redrafted, when Contentful has to be updated, then the only place to change is the `file` field, metadata and links to the image will be preserved
- [x] Published [a single city scale tile](https://app.contentful.com/spaces/zy8ufabt1tm0/entries/6ciH7fjDaJE1CASvSIuUcy) and [the first few images of town scale tiles](https://app.contentful.com/spaces/zy8ufabt1tm0/assets) that fit within that smaller scale tile

## Doing

- [x] Cropping the first 25 town scale tile images
- [ ] Publishing tiles in Contentful that corrispond to each of these
- [ ] Planning to replace this manual effort with scripts

## To Do

- [ ] Build a UI that links from the city scale tile down to the 25 town scale tiles laid out in a grid
- [ ] Write a script that can crop a city scale tile into 25 town scale tiles automagically
  - There's a package called [Jimp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jimp) that does programmatic cropping
- [ ] Build a system that automagically crops a city tile into town tiles and publishes them on Contentful

Perhaps not but I realise that's not the reason why I'm not just creating a project in the repo to "log" all of this

1. When I started this [keeping notes on this website thing](https://www.laurencelord.co.uk/notes/i-am-writing-for-myself), it was to bring things together in one place
1. This here "note" gives me a fast way to read and write an overview, precisely because it's all one page
