title: Mapping a learning path for creating digital maps

I spent a few hours reading up on WebGL, OpenStreetMaps and digital cartography in general. I followed a few different paths and didn't "get to the end" of any of them. This is definately something that would need more time.

## I'd like to note the different paths I'd like to follow on this subject

### Cartography in general

### WebGL (the basics for creating 3D maps)

This article explores how to take data within a WebGL project, and project it into the proper spaces to display it on the screen. It assumes a knowledge of basic matrix math using translation, scale, and rotation matrices. It explains the three core matrices that are typically used when composing a 3D scene: the model, view and projection matrices.

### Creating a globe-scale map with something like a custom instance of Open Street maps
