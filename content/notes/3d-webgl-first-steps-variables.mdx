There's an excellent [WebGL tutorial on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/Tutorial) that gets you to render a spinning cube, covered with an image, on an HTML Canvas, using WebGL and [a library called `gl-matrix`](https://github.com/toji/gl-matrix).

Below are my result from the tutorial:

Next, I'd like to add some controls to the UI to make the 3D rendering interactive.

## Interactive features to add

- I want to be able to rotate the cube myself
- I want to be able to zoom-in on the cube

Doing the simplest thing first, let's add a control that stops the cube rotating by itself.

### Let's get into the code

Currently function called **render** runs everytime a new animation frame is available:

```js
function render(now) {
  const deltaTime = now - then;
  then = now;

  drawScene(gl, programInfo, buffers, texture, deltaTime); // highlight-line

  requestAnimationFrame(render);
}
```

We measure how much time has passed since the last animation frame and pass that into the **drawScene** function.

There is a lot going on inside `drawScene`. The bit we're interested in is where we update some state called `cubeRotation` based on the time delta.

This value gets used inside two heavily commented function calls to `mat4.rotate` from the `gl-matrix` library:

```js
mat4.rotate(
  modelViewMatrix, // destination matrix
  modelViewMatrix, // matrix to rotate
  cubeRotation, // amount to rotate in radians // highlight-line
  [0, 0, 1]
); // axis to rotate around (Z)
mat4.rotate(
  modelViewMatrix, // destination matrix
  modelViewMatrix, // matrix to rotate
  cubeRotation * 0.7, // amount to rotate in radians // highlight-line
  [0, 1, 0]
); // axis to rotate around (X)
```

To make this a bit easier to work with let's do the following clean up:

- let's rotate around the more intuitive X and Y axis, rather than X and Z
- let's use a separate variable for each axis
- let's clean up these comments

```js
const xAxis = [0, 1, 0];
mat4.rotate(modelViewMatrix, modelViewMatrix, cubeRotationX, xAxis);

const yAxis = [1, 0, 0];
mat4.rotate(modelViewMatrix, modelViewMatrix, cubeRotationY, yAxis);
```

### Pause the automatic rotation

Now we're ready to stop the cube rotating by itself.

We can introduce a checkbox and check it's value before updating `cubeRotationX` and `cubeRotationY`

```js
+ if (document.getElementById("autoRotation").checked === true) {
  cubeRotationX += deltaTime / 2000;
  cubeRotationY += deltaTime / 1400;
+ } // highlight-line
```

### Control the rotation

Let's add some more controls to the HTML

```html
<div>
  <label htmlFor="cubeRotationX">X</label>
  <input type="number" id="cubeRotationX" name="cubeRotationX" step="0.05" />
</div>
<div>
  <label htmlFor="cubeRotationX">Y</label>
  <input type="number" id="cubeRotationY" name="cubeRotationY" step="0.05" />
</div>
```

And use those values if we're not rotating automatically

```js
// each time we run render
if (document.getElementById("autoRotation").checked === false) {
  cubeRotationY = document.getElementById("cubeRotationY").value;
  cubeRotationX = document.getElementById("cubeRotationX").value;
}
```
