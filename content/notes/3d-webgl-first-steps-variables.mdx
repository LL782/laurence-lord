My starting point is a [MDN WebGL tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/Tutorial) the results of which are embedded above â€“ a spinning cube, covered with an image, rendered on an HTML Canvas using WebGL and [a library called `gl-matrix`](https://github.com/toji/gl-matrix).

Having inherited this code I'd like to make it interactive.

## Interactive features

- Rotate the cube
- Zoom-in on the cube

### Simplest thing first

<EmbedFrame src="/embeds/3d-web-gl-first-steps-variables/pause-spinning-cube/" />

A checkbox toggles automatic rotation. How?

### Let's get into the code

A function called **`render`** runs every time a new animation frame is available...

```js
function render(now) {
  const deltaTime = now - then;
  then = now;

  drawScene(gl, programInfo, buffers, texture, deltaTime);

  requestAnimationFrame(render);
}
```

A measure of time-since-the-last-frame is passed into **`drawScene`** every time we [re]render

There is a lot going on in `drawScene`. It turns out we're interested in some state called `cubeRotation`. It is updated based on our time delta.

See the `mat4.rotate` method from `gl-matrix` below:

```js
mat4.rotate(
  modelViewMatrix, // destination matrix
  modelViewMatrix, // matrix to rotate
  cubeRotation, // amount to rotate in radians // highlight-line
  [0, 0, 1]
); // axis to rotate around (Z)
mat4.rotate(
  modelViewMatrix, // destination matrix
  modelViewMatrix, // matrix to rotate
  cubeRotation * 0.7, // amount to rotate in radians // highlight-line
  [0, 1, 0]
); // axis to rotate around (X)
```

To make this a bit easier I do some clean up:

- Rotate around the more intuitive `X` and `Y` axis, rather than `X` and `Z`
- Use a separate variables for `cubeRotationX` and `cubeRotationY` â€“ _no more random `* 0.7`_
- Replace comments with named variables

```js
const xAxis = [0, 1, 0];
mat4.rotate(modelViewMatrix, modelViewMatrix, cubeRotationX, xAxis);

const yAxis = [1, 0, 0];
mat4.rotate(modelViewMatrix, modelViewMatrix, cubeRotationY, yAxis);
```

#### Now to make rotation conditional

We simply put an `if` block around the code that updates `cubeRotationX` and `cubeRotationY`

```js
if (document.getElementById("autoRotation").checked) {
  cubeRotationX += deltaTime / 2000;
  cubeRotationY += deltaTime / 1400;
}
```

Our checkbox toggles automatic rotation ðŸŽ‰

### Controlling X and Y rotation

<EmbedFrame src="/embeds/3d-web-gl-first-steps-variables/control-spinning-cube/" />

We adding some more inputs to the HTML

```html
<div>
  <label htmlFor="cubeRotationX">X</label>
  <input type="number" id="cubeRotationX" name="cubeRotationX" step="0.05" />
</div>
<div>
  <label htmlFor="cubeRotationX">Y</label>
  <input type="number" id="cubeRotationY" name="cubeRotationY" step="0.05" />
</div>
```

And use their values when not auto-rotating

```js
if (document.getElementById("autoRotation").checked === false) {
  cubeRotationY = document.getElementById("cubeRotationY").value;
  cubeRotationX = document.getElementById("cubeRotationX").value;
}
```

### Control the zoom

Imagining a camera is pointing at our 3D cube. There are at least three ways to achieve a "zoom" effect, relatively speaking:

1. Move the cube closer to the camera
1. Move the camera closer to the cube
1. Change the magnification of the camera
1. Increase the size of the cube

<EmbedFrame src="/embeds/3d-web-gl-first-steps-variables/zoom-spinning-cube/" />

I've picked variables related to two or three of these concepts out of the code:

| Vary                 | Variable               | Notes                                     |
| :------------------- | :--------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| Cube position        | `drawingPositionZ`     | A starting point for drawing the cube     |
| Camera position      | n/a                    | Everything is relative. See cube position |
| Camera magnification | `fieldOfViewInRadians` | Narrows or widens the view                |
| Cube size            | n/a                    | Not simple to vary atm in this code       |

This concludes this first exploration into making some interactive WebGL.

Next I'll take a look at some libraries (e.g. ThreeJS). I've found [this list](https://medevel.com/16-webgl-opensource-frameworks/#7-webglstudio-js-litescene-js-open-source-web-3d-graphic-editor-creator) handy

### Take home points

1. We re-render the scene every time an animation frame is available and the browser handles it well
1. It is simple to including variables from HTML inputs in the `drawScene` function
1. In this code the easiest way to add a zoom effect was to move the scene closer to the "perspective". Although this won't work in all other scenarios it's an option that works.
