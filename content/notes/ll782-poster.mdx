## Lab notes

### For users:

1. Click on the image or the link above
1. If you have a mouse, move it around the screen
1. Enjoy watching the image tilt and stretch

### For developers:

#### Theme 1: Generating an Open Graph image in the browser

1. Rather than using Photoshop I'm experimenting with using CSS and img tags to make a photo montage
1. Notice the PNG mask on top of the JPG and the CSS where I've pixel pushed them both around
1. To generate the og:image for this size, I'll resize my browser to 1200 x 630px and screenshot it

#### Theme 2: A little experimenting with 3D CSS

1. I hadn't heard of [the perspective attribute in CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/perspective) before, so there's some experimentation with that
1. I didn't apply a `translateX` in the end because I didn't want to effect the og:image screenshot
1. However a bit of `translateX` does play well with the `perspective`, `perspective-origin`, `rotateY` and `rotateX`

#### Theme 3: Updating CSS vars using Javascript

1. I've been meaning to do this since Lea Verou demonstrated them years ago
1. The basic idea is to track the mouseover event with JS and update a [custom-property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*) in your CSS
1. Have the JS write something from 0-1 and then `calc()` lets you keep the visual tweaking inside the CSS
