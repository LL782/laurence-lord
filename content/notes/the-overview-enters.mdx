[The Overview](https://github.com/users/LL782/projects/1) - a GitHub project where I can see everything in one place. I don't want to repeat everything from the project README but let's note the objectives at least:

1. Easy to view how everything is going
1. A landing page for, What to work on
1. Cross pollinate planning approachs

## Notes

### How's it going?

Feels good so far. I'm still getting everything visible (see [LL782 #2](https://github.com/LL782/LL782/issues/2)) and loving the insights already.

### Highlights <Emoji label="nerd face">ðŸ¤“</Emoji>

1. It's **easier to balance tasks** on different projects when they are listed along side one another
1. There's a Marie Kondo thing â€“ put everything into **one pile** and the reality (and absurdity) of how much is there becomes clearer
1. I've deleted or archived a bunch of repos

### Observations <Emoji label="electric torch">ðŸ”¦</Emoji>

1. Lots of the repos don't have projects or milestones
1. There is manual effort required to ensure all issues get visiblility in The Overview
1. I haven't done high level planning on most of the projects yet

### Ponderings <Emoji label="thinking face">ðŸ¤”</Emoji>

1. Repos are not projects â€“ the terms shouldn't be used interchangeably
1. A repo without a project behind it doesn't get included in The Overview
1. It this going to help me get more done or is it a distraction. The old procrastination question
