[**The Overview**](https://github.com/users/LL782/projects/1) lets me zoom out from a single personal project and see issues from across my whole profile in one place. I think of [Scrum of Scrums](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/scrum-of-scrums) â€“ this is a project of projects. The objectives are as follows:

1. Easy to view all workflows together
1. A landing page for, What to work on
1. Cross pollinate planning approaches

## Notes

### How's it going?

Feels good so far. I'm still getting everything visible (see [Ensure all existing issues are visible in The Overview â€“ LL782 #2](https://github.com/LL782/LL782/issues/2)) but getting great insights already.

### Highlights <Emoji label="nerd face">ðŸ¤“</Emoji>

1. It's **easier to prioritise issues** of different projects when they are listed together
1. There's a Marie Kondo thing â€“ put everything into **one pile** and the absurdity of how much you have becomes clear
1. I've deleted or archived a bunch of repos without much hesitation. The level of abstraction makes it **easier to refine my scope**

### Observations <Emoji label="electric torch">ðŸ”¦</Emoji>

1. Lots of the repos I consider important don't have projects or milestones
1. There is manual effort required to ensure all issues get visiblility in The Overview
1. I haven't done high level planning on most of the projects before now

### Ponderings <Emoji label="thinking face">ðŸ¤”</Emoji>

1. Repos are not projects â€“ the terms shouldn't be used interchangeably
2. Should I continue to maintain individual projects on a repository level?
3. Is this going to help me get more done or is it a distraction? The old procrastination question 
4. I hope to measure the success of this by seeing a few of the projects mature and progress
