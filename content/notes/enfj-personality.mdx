description: A note of my Myers Briggs personality type test result, taken today
title: My personality type is "Assertive Protagonist", according to this test
---

' just wanted to make a note of this. I wonder if it may change over time.

I took the test today (2021-12-29) at [16personalities.com](https://www.16personalities.com) and the result was:

- Type: [`Assertive Protagonist`](https://www.16personalities.com/enfj-personality)
- Code: [`ENFJ-A`](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/assertive-protagonist-enfj-a-vs-turbulent-protagonist-enfj-t)
- Role: [`Diplomat`](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/roles-diplomats)
- Strategy: [`People Mastery`](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/strategies-people-mastery)

I haven't read all this yet, as now is not the time. It's interesting stuff though and reminds me of reading about my classification in the [Chinese Zodiac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac)

Funnily enough, I got that feeling while reading my current managers personality type, which is ["Architect"](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality). I was imagining I'd take the test and that would be my type too! Funny how certain writing can give that kind of impression.
