title: "'Why' is not important to answer when it comes to what I'm doing at a given time. On the otherhand, How and What am I doing instead are valuable questions to get into the habit of answering"
---

Before I get into this, there are other places where I espouse the importance of 'Why'. Project planning is one such place, briefing a team on work to be done is another. So meet me part way in this communication if you want to get the most out of it. I'm putting forward an idea that has value to me (the source) and through effective reinterpretation it can have value to you too (the destination).

Okay, so here's a little more context: This line of thought follows on from catching myself in the act of deviating from a given plan. Or put another way, What do I do instead when I planned to do one thing but end up doing another?

I'm trying to catch myself in the act of doing this. I caught this one earlier: I plan to work on a personal project but instead I end up washing the dishes. Interestingly since catching that I don't do it anymore. Further context around this deceptively mundane topic is that I'm doing some work that involves looking at my existing tendencies and with a desire to make changes. In actual fact the desire is to get more personal projects done and the approach I'm employing is better neuro lingistic programming. So naturally, seemingly mundane things come up and some prove themselves to be significant complications.

So back to the original note: Answering What and How instead of Why is advised in certain self-reflection scenarios. That leads me to ask, which "What" and "How" questions are valuable?

> What are you seeking?

That's one example! Compare that question to, "Why are you doing this when you said you were going to do that?". The highlighted one cuts to the chase. It eliminates waste. When it comes to well established habits in an adult, I am advised that asking, Why? – could lead me down rabbit holes. Whereas asking, What do I do instead? How do I go from intending to do one thing and instead doing another? – those kinds of questions could bring me back on track or reveal something else that needs addressing.

I'm thinking this through as I write. I feels like these rabbit holes are examples of complexity in a program that isn't needed and if I can understand **what** the complexity is doing, and **how** and replace it with something simple, or simply remove it, then there is far less to be gained from going down the rabbit holes.

This was a very raw note that is very particular to me. I'll finish it off for now by collecting the remaining, related notes from the same page:

- What are the habits?
- Styles of avoidance
- Styles of doing things
- "I don't like this **what** should I do instead?"
- Pay Off, desire, fear, habituation – these result in action
