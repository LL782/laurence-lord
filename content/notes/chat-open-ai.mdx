This is what it had to say:

> Here are a few potential strategies for promoting a small ecommerce website that sells bespoke artwork:
>
> 1. Leverage social media: Social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest can be powerful marketing tools for small businesses, as they allow you to reach a large audience quickly and inexpensively. Create accounts for your business on these platforms and regularly post high-quality images of your artwork, along with compelling descriptions and calls to action. Use hashtags and tags to make it easier for people to find your posts and engage with your content.
>
> 1. Offer discounts and promotions: Consider offering discounts and promotions to attract new customers and encourage them to make their first purchase. For example, you could offer a discount on the first purchase, or a bundle deal that includes multiple pieces of artwork.
>
> 1. Partner with other businesses: Reach out to businesses that complement your product, such as home decor stores or interior design firms, and see if they would be interested in partnering with you. For example, you could offer to provide artwork for their showroom or to feature their products on your website in exchange for promoting your business to their audience.
>
> 1. Utilize email marketing: Email marketing can be an effective way to reach potential customers and promote your business. Collect email addresses from customers who make a purchase or sign up for your mailing list, and then send them regular newsletters or promotional emails. Be sure to include compelling images of your artwork, along with information about any new products or promotions you are offering.
>
> 1. Invest in search engine optimization (SEO): SEO refers to the practice of optimizing your website so that it appears at the top of search engine results for relevant keywords. This can help you attract more traffic to your website and increase your visibility to potential customers. To improve your SEO, make sure your website is well-designed and user-friendly, and include relevant keywords in your website's content and meta tags. You can also consider hiring a professional SEO firm to help you improve your search engine rankings.
