afterthoughts: This note should have an "afterthought" so we can test this feature is working. I expect it to be included in an aside at the bottom of the page.

I don't currently have ~~any~~ <sup><a href="#many-checks">[many]</a></sup> automated checks on this website ‚Äì not something I'm proud of but a reality I'm willing to accept. I want to get up and running quickly and I'm still experimenting with this technology (Gatsby primarily) so borrowing a little is acceptable. If I start incurring interest on the debt I'll consider paying it back.

So for now I perform an unscripted manual check quite naturally. I look at the live site after I've made changes to it or added new content.

This page is somewhere I can note the features I have used on the site ‚Äì a single place to quickly review everything. If I automate the natural checks I'm making I can start by checking what's on this page.

## Process

1. Add a new feature to the site
1. Include an example of it here
1. Periodically check everything on this page is working

<p>
  <Emoji label="warning sign">‚ö†Ô∏è</Emoji> Would I notice if I added new features
  and forgot to include them here?
</p>

<p>
  <Emoji label="warning sign">‚ö†Ô∏è</Emoji> Would I notice if any of them broke?
</p>

<p>
  <Emoji label="robot face">ü§ñ</Emoji> And that's why we automate
</p>

## Features of this site so far

### JSX and Markdown

I'm not checking on this, it's a feature of `gatsby-plugin-mdx`

However, `shortcodes` are the JSX components that I pass in to `MDXProvider` and my automated checks wouldn't tell me if they were missing

#### Expected shortcodes

##### Emoji

```jsx
<Emoji label="positive checkmark">‚úÖ</Emoji>
```

<p>
  <Emoji label="positive checkmark">‚úÖ</Emoji> My Emoji component adds
  accessibility attributes around an emoji
</p>

##### Link

<p>
  <Link to="/">Home</Link>
</p>

The Gatsby `<Link>` is available to all MDX layouts

### Frontmatter

Optional data about a <Link to="/notes/">Note</Link> page.

| Key             | Use                           |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `afterthoughts` | end of note page              |
| `date`          | sort of notes index           |
| `description`   | metadata descriptions         |
| `image`         | displayed at top of note page |
| `image`         | referenced in metadata image  |
| `imageAlt`      | alt text for image (above)    |
| `title`         | listed in notes index         |
| `title`         | metadata titles for note page |
| `title`         | top of note page              |
| `title`         | window title for note page    |

It's [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) and the notes are written in markdown. I haven't discovered yet why the files are `.mdx` and not just `.md`. Perhaps I can put react components into them.

### I don't have "many" automated checks

Initially I wrote that I don't have "any" automated checks, then I started to notice automated checks that I had ignored:

- **Linting** should happen whenever I save, assuming the format of the document is correct. If it fails I notice. This is a frequent, super cheap check that is very easy to keep green.

- **Deployment and build** checks are another frequent, unobtrusive check that should not be underrated. When I push to my repo the automated pipeline runs build and deploy tasks. If there are errors then deployment fails and I notice.
