title: I'm writing for myself. It's important when designing communication to know what you want to say, who you want to say it to and how you want them to feel. This isn't that – it's not designer communication – I'm writing for myself

**So why write at all?** Clear your head, get your thoughts in line, practice articulation, store some of your thoughts elsewhere (like backup or archive). <a href="https://twoormore.eu/">Jorge</a> called it _external memory_.

Something about writing has always evoked an audience for me. I imagine people studying my words when I'm not there. So I fantasise that my writing has an audience but I am not _writing for an audience_. I am not putting effort into designing what I want to say, who to, or how I want them to feel. This frees me to write what I want and not worry about success. Time will tell if it has much appeal to others but that's not the primary concern. I remind myself to just relax and write because I want to. There is value in that
