## Lab work

[A little 3D environment with two cameras and two light switches](/labs/a-frame-001/)

## Lab notes

### For users:

1. Move around with the keyboard or mobile motion detection
1. Switch cameras and turn lights on and off
1. This is a quick experiment but if you'd like to [raise issues](https://github.com/LL782/laurence-lord/issues) please do

### For developers:

1. This was built with [A-Frame WebGL library](https://aframe.io/)
1. It took a couple of days at most. A-Frame is very easy to get started with
1. There is no "collision physics" in here so you can run through anything
1. [The code is here](https://github.com/LL782/laurence-lord/edit/main/static/labs/a-frame-001/index.html) _⚠️ Warning: quick and dirty code_
