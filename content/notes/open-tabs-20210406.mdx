title: I'm going through my open tabs and taking a note of anything worth keeping. It's my first day on the bench and this is helping me to take stock of different things I am interested in and make plans for what to do next

afterthoughts: Since setting out to do this I've end up building myself this site in order to take these notes. I guess I don't respect timeboxes when it's my first few days on the bench ðŸ¤·

I have loads of tabs open. each could be:

- read now
- close won't read
- note to read later
  - in Pocket
- note to work on later
  - in Trello
- note to refer back to later
  - Bookmark
- take notes here to enhance comprehension and add to future discoverability

My intention: clear my head after my most recent engagement and nurture that self trust relationship where I put something to one side saying, "I'll come back to that"

I have this nagging suspicion that it's a waste of time. Am I procrastinating? I want to find some good stuff and decide what to focus on next but I already know what I want to do. There are some really good tabs about WebGL and combining 3D assets with a map UI.

So I'll timebox this exercise to today and tomorrow and then get stuck into those. Hopefully those will appear in the list below

## Observations while I did this

1. The list at the top is good. Especially deciding what goes where and why.
1. With the timebox and the finite options I find it easier to close tabs that no longer grip me
1. The difference between a truely gripping tab and one that has lost it's appeal is easier to spot when you put all the tabs in one big pile like some kind of Marie Kondo clothing sort through
