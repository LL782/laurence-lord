description: I just discovered that Lead Time talks about code commited to code in production. What about the time spent on work leading up to that?

So Googling around the **DORA Metric** for **Lead Time** I find it is commonly accepted to be **from the moment code is commited until there is code working in production**

That makes sense â€“ it's a great metric for measuring the quality of infrastructure and pipelines â€“ and obviously some of the work done to deliver value to the customer. But what about all the time spent on work leading up to that. I'd always assumed that was part of the standard metric too:

**How long it takes to a get a new idea to a customer**

That is obviously harder to measure but seems more important in many ways.

I imagine I'll keep pondering this for some time to come <Emoji label="thinking face">ðŸ¤”</Emoji>
