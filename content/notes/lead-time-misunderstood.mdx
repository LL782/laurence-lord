description: I just discovered that Lead Time talks about code commited to code in production. What about the time spent on work leading up to that?

So Googling around the **DORA Metric** for **Lead Time** is commonly accepted to be **from the moment code is commited until code in working in production**

That makes sense â€“ it's a great metric for measuring quality infrastructure and pipelines.

Today I discovered that. See, for the last however many years I thought one of the four key metrics was measuring **how long it takes to a get a new idea infront of customers**

That is obviously harder to measure but seems more important in many ways.
