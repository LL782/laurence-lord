\t
\t********************************************************************
\t
\t  Hello and welcome to your guide to updating your website!
\t  
\t  This guide provides notes on:
\t  
\t  	*  Editing HTML and PHP documents.
\t  	*  'Previewing' the changes you make on your 'local' computer.
\t  	*  And uploading and downloading files using ftp software.
\t  
\t  
\t  In addition to this document four HTML template files and one
\t  CSS document have been prepared.

\t  
\t  			    INITIAL NOTES
\t  
\t
\t  WORKING WITH WEB FILES
\t
\t  Your site is stored on your hosting at ftp.torema.com.br*
\t
\t  At this location there is a folder called 'htdocs', this is the
\t  'root' folder of the site.
\t  
\t  It is a good idea to store a copy of your site on your own 
\t  computer.  This is know as the 'local' copy of the site.
\t  
\t  Keep this copy inside a folder called 'root'.
\t  
\t  The contents of the 'htdocs' and the 'root' folders should be 
\t  equal.
\t  
\t  
\t  When you edit your website always take a copy of the files you 
\t  want to edit from the 'remote root folder'('htdocs' and place 
\t  them in a similar location within your local root folder.
\t
\t  Before you start editing the site open the files locally in both
\t  your web browser and your text editor*.
\t
\t  
\t  *ftp:  I would recommend that you use the online ftp program
\t         at www.streamline.ftp.net however you may feel more 
\t         comfortable using Explorer.
\t
\t  *text editor:   I would recommend using Vim to edit your web 
\t         pages.Vim can be downloaded free via 'Cream (for Vim)', 
\t         currently available at: -
\t
http://ufpr.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/cream/cream-0-38-gvim-7-0-152.exe
\t  
\t********************************************************************
\t  
\t  			EDITING AND PREVIEWING 
\t  
\t  
\t  Open the file you want to edit open in both your text editor and
\t  web browser.  After making a change in the text editor save the
\t  file and refresh your web browser.  You will be able to see the 
\t  effect of what you have changed.
\t  
\t  
\t  				UPLOADING
\t  		(After previewing the changes 'locally') 
\t 
\t  
\t  If you are happy with the changes you have made:
\t  
\t    Upload the new copy of your web file to the remote root folder 
\t    using your ftp program.  You can now view the changes online.
\t  
\t  
\t  If you are not happy with the changes you have made and are unable
\t  to fix any problems that you have encountered:
\t  
\t    Don't worry!  Simply delete the local copy of the file and take
\t    another copy of the fill from the remote root folder.
\t  
\t   
\t  Easy!!
\t  
\t********************************************************************
\t 
\t  
\t	  		ABOUT THE TEMPLATE FILES
\t  
\t  Inside the 'root' folder of your site you will find four HTML
\t  templates.
\t  
\t  
\t  'template.html'
\t  *************** 
\t  
\t  Look at this file in your text editor. The file provides notes 
\t  about every element of the HTML file.  You do not need to know 
\t  everything in this file to edit your pages but reading it will 
\t  inmprove your understanding of HTML. 
\t  
\t  'template2.html' 
\t  **************** 
\t  
\t  This file provides examples of all the ways you can layout the  
\t  content of your webpages. 
\t  
\t  Look at the page in your browser to select the style you want, 
\t  Then in your text editor copy and paste the code you want and  
\t  place it in your new/edited web page. 
\t  
\t  'template-blank.html' 
\t  ********************* 
\t  
\t  If you want to make a new page for your site use this template. 
\t  Do not edit this file!  Make a copy of the file and fill the  
\t  page with you new content. 
\t  
\t  'template-cases.html' 
\t  ********************* 
\t  
\t  This file is like 'template-blank.html'.  Use this template for 
\t  creating new pages for you Cases section.
\t
\t********************************************************************
\t 
\t  That is everything you really need to know to start editing your 
\t  website.  Below are some extra details that you may want to read 
\t  if you have any doubt or encounter any problems.
\t
\t********************************************************************
\t  
\t  			REGARDING NOTE
\t  
\t  The template files are full of notes.
\t  
\t  You can also find shorter notes in the other pages.
\t  
\t  The notes are there to guide you and to help you keep the code 
\t  organised.  You may even choose to write some notes of your own.
\t
\t  Notes always start and end with the following marks:
\t
\t		   <!-- this is a note --> 
\t  
\t  Anything inside these marks is a note and will not be displayed by
\t  the browser.
\t
\t  The HTML will behave in exactly the same way with or without the 
\t  notes.
\t
\t********************************************************************
\t  
\t  			    REGARDING PHP
\t  
\t  
\t  A PHP file is very similar to an HTML file.
\t  
\t  There are two main differences:
\t  
\t  1. PHP can do things that HTML cannot.
\t  
\t  2. A PHP file cannot be previewed local.  It need to be online
\t     to work.
\t  
\t  Because of this second point you will have to be a little more
\t  careful when editing PHP.
\t  
\t  Before editing make a copy of the PHP file and do not edit it.
\t  This copy will be a 'backup'.
\t  
\t  If anything should go wrong while you are editing delete the file
\t  you have edited and put the backup file back in its place.
\t
\t********************************************************************  
\t  
\t                    USING THE 'Em Constução' PAGE
\t  
\t  
\t  To use the 'Em Construção' page it help to understand how to use
\t  'index.html'.
\t  
\t  If someone visits www.torema.com.br the file that they are being 
\t  shown is 'index.html'.
\t  
\t  There are two files that you may want to take the place of 
\t  index.html.  The homepage or the construction page.
\t  
\t  Give both these files different names.
\t  
\t    i.e. 'construction-index.html' and 'home.html'
\t  
\t  When you want to show the homepage make a copy of 'home.html' and
\t  rename it 'index.html'.
\t  
\t  When you want to show the construction page make a copy of 
\t  'construction-index.html' and rename it 'index.html'.
\t
