		<p class="titley">History</p>
     	<p>The Chronology below covering 1945 - 1962 shows the period riven with conflict as anti-colonial
        forces sought independence and the dismemberment of empires. The increasing
        rivalry and conflict between the western alliance led by the USA [First
        World] and the eastern bloc led by the USSR [Second World] was an important
        factor. Anti-colonial forces often received direct military aid from
        the Soviet Union, as happened in both North Korea and in Vietnam. In
        other cases, economic aid provided an alternative to Western capital.
        India relied on the Soviet Union for a period, and Soviet support was
        an important factor in the Cuban resistance to US aggression.</p>
		<p>The 1950s and 1960s saw large part of the world freed from colonial occupation;
      the pink bits showing the British Empire largely disappeared from maps.
      However, the domination did not necessarily disappear. The economic and
      political ties frequently meant less visible but equally effective control.
      For example, the French maintained their economic power in West Africa
      and parts of Arabia. One of the problems besetting militant Cineastes in
      the region was the control of both production and distribution by French
      capital.</p>
	  <p>Newly independent leaders were often suborned in the manner satirised in
      Semb&egrave;ne's 'Xala' [1974]. When more militant leaders led fundamental
      changes the responses included: assassination as in the death of Patrice
      Lumumba with CIA involvement in the Congo: economic warfare and subversion
      as with the US against the Cuba: and direct military intervention as carried
      out by the British and French in Egypt. This led to armed and cultural
      resistance against both the neo-colonial powers and their satraps in the
      countries themselves.</p>
	  <p>This militant conflict was reflected in the wider culture, including cinema.
      Already in the 1950s there were films with a conscious political content
      and a commitment to liberation. In the 1960s there was an explosion of
      this type of cinema, as can be seen in the three continental examples.
      Importantly, these young filmmakers were involved in both theory and practice.
      So there was a stream of political writings and manifestos. The best known
      are highlighted in these pages. However, there were numerous examples,
      just as there were numerous films. Both in some way tapped into and supported
      the wave of liberation fervour and struggle.</p>
	  <p>The 1960s were the decade of Independence, especially in Africa. There
      were, though, areas of reaction. Notable were those countries with a large
      indigenous settler population. South Africa, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Namibia
      saw long struggles by the indigenous populations. In Latin America, formal
      independence had been achieved in the C19th. The problem in the 1960s was
      US dominance [hegemony]. The Cuban revolution sparked a number of militant
      and cultural examples. The struggle against neo-colonial regimes subservient
      to the USA led to frequent military coups and juntas. The most notorious
      was the CIA backed coup in Chile in 1973. Such reaction produced not just
      cinemas of resistance but underground cinemas, which operated outside of
      the established filmmaking and film audience networks.</p>
	  <p>By the 1980s, the idea of a Third Cinema was firmly established, both in
      the countries dominated by neo-colonialism and in intellectual and academic
      circles which focused on film and cinema. In 1986, a conference was held
      in Edinburgh that included filmmakers, activists, critics and theorists.
      The conference highlighted areas of agreement and disagreement, but it
      also broadly mapped out a terrain for Third Cinema. Teshombe Gabriel's
      model for critical inquiry into Third Cinema was the most developed of
      these.</p>
	  <p>The 1990s however saw a contraction in the space for resistance. The demise
      of the Soviet Union and the idea of a Second World, a socialist camp, clearly
      weakened anti-colonial forces. Many of the major liberation conflicts have
      died down and a number of movements have made settlements with the imperialists.
      In South Africa, black majority rule has been achieved, but the control
      by multinationals and white settlers of the key economic resources has
      not changed. Hence the inability to deal with the aids crisis.</p>
	  <p>The downturn in militant struggle has been reflected in cinema. There appear
      to be fewer films with a clear militant stamp released into existing cinema
      circuits. However, the decline in alternative exhibition in a country like
      Britain makes it difficult to have a clear sense of world cinema. Another
      Conference organised in London by the British Film Institute on 'Africa
      and the History of Cinematic Ideas', saw more than one delegate pronounce
      the idea of Third Cinema dead.</p>
	  <p> Yet there are still films that seem to fulfil the criteria for a cinema
      that 'directly opposes the system' of colonialism and neo-colonialism.
      Moreover, new technologies mean that films can be produced and circulated
      outside the cinematic institutions. Young filmmakers are working with video
      and digital video and clearly many of these confront the continuing domination
      by a handful of advanced capitalist countries of the majority of the world's
      population.</p>
	  <p>&quot;...many men and women who up till then would never have thought of producing
      a literary [cinematic] work, now that they find themselves in exceptional
      circumstances - feel the need to speak to their nation, to compose the
      sentence which expresses the heart of the people and to become the mouthpiece
      of a new reality in action.&quot; </p>
