      <p class="titley">AFRICA</p>
      <p>This continent and its film industries are still marked by
         the influence of colonialism. The attitude of westerners to Africans under 
	 colonialism is aptly illustrated  by the following.</p>
      <p class="quote">&quot;For this audience that we call primitive, we must make films for Africans.
         The scenario will be simple and will deal with few characters. The characters
         will be easily distinguishable from one another, and they will each have
         well-defined habits. The spectator must be able, without great effort,
         to identify with the heroes whom he will imitate... The technique for
         such films will generally be analogous to the one used when filming for
         children.&quot;</p>	 
	  <p class="ref">[Father Van den Heuvel, Director of the Congolese
         Centre for Catholic Action Cinema]</p>
      <p>The representation of Africans in films made in the colonial countries
         was equally racist.  Examples include witness films like 'Sanders of the River' [UK
         1935] and 'King Solomon&#8217;s Mines' [USA 1950].</p>
      <p>North of the Sahara, in the Arab countries, there are indigenous
         cinemas which, in the case of Egypt, go back to the 1920s. South
         of the Sahara indigenous filmmaking only became possible after the colonial powers
         loosened their direct hold. So Sub-Saharan African film only appeared
         in the 1960s. And even then it faced immense difficulties as there
         were almost no production facilities and Hollywood or European
         Corporations dominated both distribution and exhibition.</p>
      <p> Tahar Cheriaa, founder of one of Africa's two film festivals
        once said &quot;...each African cinema is like a 'monster': a head (of filmmakers
    	and their films) without a body (without the marketing structure to support
        them and the audiences that such a structure would ensure).&quot;</p>
      <p>The form of neo-colonialism practised by the French meant that they
         did fund and support indigenous African film. For this reason most
         of the notable early Sub-Saharan African films were made in what is labelled
         Francophone Africa. </p>
      <p>The limitations of the support can be gauged by the necessity of nearly all of
	   these films being edited in France.</p>
      <p>A major pioneer figure in African filmmaking is Ousmane Semb&egrave;ne from Senegal. 'Borom
        Sarret' [1963] was his first film in a career that continues today. Semb&egrave;ne
        was a founder member of the Fed&eacute;ration Panafricaine des Cin&eacute;astes
        [FEPACI] and a regular participant in the Festival Panafricain du Cin&eacute;ma &agrave; Ouagadougou
        [FESPACO] in Burkina Faso. Semb&egrave;ne and his films provide the major
        case study in Sub-Saharan African films. His filmaking practice clearly lies within 
		the domain of Third Cinema. And his work has had a great influence on other politically 
		conscious filmmakers around the continent. He also remains one of the few African filmmakers whose films can be accessed in the UK.</p>
      <p>Such activities have helped develop African filmmaking. However,
        there are still few adequate production facilities. For example,
        a boom in filmmaking in Nigeria is totally dependent on video formats and
        distribution. Across Africa distribution and exhibition remain
        in thrall to Western Cinemas and to a lesser extent Bollywood and Hong Kong action movies.</p>

        <p class=titley>AFRICA - DISTRIBUTION AND EXHIBITION</p>
      	   <p>In 1978 Kwate Nee-Owoo listed 'What's On' with films in both Ghana and Upper
  			  Volta [later Burkina Faso]. He listed sixteen Hollywood films, twelve Hong Kong films,
  			  five European films and one specifically from the UK. There were no African
  			  films listed at all.</p>
  			<p>The Motion Picture Export Association of America, formed in 1946, co-ordinated
 			  the export of films from the Hollywood Majors. In the Maghreb, [Morocco, Algeria
  			  and Tunisia] they worked through sub-agencies of their subsidiaries in Paris.
 			  In the Anglophone area they formed American Motion Picture Export Company of
  			  America, which quickly achieved a dominance in distribution.</p>
            <p>The exception to this US dominance was in the Francophone territories
              of western and Equatorial Africa, [including Senegal, Mali, and
              Upper Volta]. Here the Compagnie Africaine Cin&eacute;matographique
              et Commercielle and Soci&eacute;t&eacute; d'Exploitation Cin&eacute;matographique
              Africaine controlled the market. Both of these companies were controlled
              from Monaco and their profits were accumulated there. They owned
              60 to 80% of the cinemas in Francophone Africa, these included
              70 in Senegal, 12 in Upper Volta and 19 in Mali. The most common
              alternative exhibitor was of Lebanese origin. The companies directly
              ran some cinemas, other were run on a percentage basis. Their standard
              fare was most frequently small-budget films, acquired in Paris
              and dubbed into French. Commonly the films were acquired by outright
              purchase rather than on the normal percentage basis. </p>
            <p>The creation of FEPACI in 1969 - 70 led to an organised offensive
              against the French dominance. At the same time Upper Volta and
              Mali nationalised their cinemas. This led to some assistance by
              SECMA in the production and distribution of an African feature
              film. However, Hollywood was now planning an expansion in the new
              markets of the independent African States. They created an organisation
              specifically for the Francophone area, Afro-American Films Inc.
              The main office was set-up in Dakar. The new organisation, with
              its European partners like Gaumont, imposed the percentage basis
              deals normal elsewhere on this market. </p>
            <p>The French response involved two aspects.The French Ministry of
              Coop&eacute;ration proposed a 'multinational film consortium' to
              both import and distribute films in Francophone Africa. This was
              to include representatives from both African governments and Euro-American
              distributors, and was named Films Afrique. One important function
              was to distribute African films in their country of origin. Meanwhile
              the French Company Union G&eacute;n&eacute;ral Cin&eacute;matographique
              bought out both SECMA and COMACICO in 1973. They then set up their
              own new company to run the networks, SOPACIA and a film purchasing
              company, CAA. This led to a conflict with AFRAM, but SOPACIA stock
              of films put it in an unusually strong position, and in 1976, after
              negotiations, distribution of Hollywood resumed, on a percentage
              basis.</p>

	  <p class="titley">SENEGAL - DISTRIBUTION AND EXHIBITION</p>
      <p>The Exhibition network had been mainly urban based, despite 80% of the population living in
          rural areas. In the colonial era cinemas were divided into first class
          seating for the European elite, second class for the African elite and
          third class for the ordinary black people. Senegal was part of the
        market of COMACICO and SECMA in a northern region comprising Senegal,
        Mauritania,
          Mali and Guinea and centred on Dakar. By 1960 there were 180 cinemas
          equipped with 35mm projection in Francophone West Africa. Practically
          all of these were owned by either COACICO or SECMA; with the few remaining
          owned by individual entrepreneurs of either Lebanese or Syrian origin.
          The equivalent of the western first-run theatre was the Salle de premi&eacute;re,
          found in the capital cities. Salles mixtes were for densely populated
          urban areas. Salles populaires were located in Medinas or ghettos. The
          turnover of films was faster in Salles populaires. In the early 1960s
          COMACICO and SECMA distributed annually 350 films, including 150 to 1260
          Hollywood features, 90 to a 100 French features, and the remaining 80
          or 90 from Indian, Arab or other cinemas. When their business empire
          rolled up in 1972 the two major companies had expanded to 250 cinemas
          with an annual gross of 120 million Francs.</p>
      <p>Early African films, such as Semb&egrave;ne&#8217;s Black Girl or The
          Money Order, though screened in Paris, were barred from audiences in
          Senegal by the monopolist practices of COMACICO and SECMA. By the late
          1960s growing threats of nationalisation and French fears of the Hollywood
          AMPEA led to changes. Hollywood exports were now channelled through
        AFRAM and the French created SOPACIA. In Senegal the government created
        SIDEC,
          a semi-private company. An agreement with SOPACIA meant continuing
        degree of control by French commercial interests. In the 1970s SIDEC
        itself
          became a national company.</p>
      <p>SIDEC now controls 80 projection sites in Senegal and an average of
          thirteen million spectators a year. They have a stock of 5,000 films
          and import
          about 400 new films every year. SIDEC now also exports to Niger, the
          Ivory Coast, Gabon and Cameroon. Since nationalisation French companies
          have tended to refuse the sale of films to SIDEC with a consequent
          increase in North American imports.</p>

	  <p>(Fed&eacute;ration Panafricaine des Cin&eacute;astes)</p>
	  <p>The French title points up the importance of Francophone filmmakers in Sub-Saharan
	  Cinema. This organization was founded in 1969. It capped a number of years
	  of struggle by African filmmakers against the dominance of the neo-colonial
	  countries, especially France, both in the production and the distribution
	  of film. The founding meeting took place at the Festival Panafricain de
	  la Culture in Algiers. It early on sought affiliation to the Organization
	  of  African Unity. It was designed to be an association of National Film Organizations
	  rather than open to individual filmmakers. By 1975 it had a membership
	  of 39 countries. The ideological and political orientation is clear in
	  its 1975 charter: "The Algiers Charter on African Cinema"</p>
	  
	  <p>The manifesto clearly shares ideological views and aims with the Latin American
	  manifestos. The work by the members, [like Sembène] displays an attempt
	  to develop both autonomous film production and autonomous distribution institutions.
	  There is also a frequent overt critical stance on imperialism [e.g. Sembène’s Camp de
	  Thiaroye] and on the indigenous elites in the pocket of imperialists, [e.g. Sembène’s 
	  Xala].</p>

	  <p>There was a further meeting of the Association in 1982. By then there had
	  been improvements in access to resources and exhibition for African filmmakers,
	  and more indigenous films were being made. However, there was still no African
	  film industry. Many films were European co-production and more likely to be seen
	  at Western Festivals than in African cinemas. A group of younger filmmakers formed
	  a Collectif L'Oeil Vert.</p> 

	  <p>"In 20 years, the African cinemas have achieved no more than the status of a
	  circus animal, caged up in festivals where people come to see them as if they
	  were sheep with five feet ... “.</p>
	  
	  <p>Despite the continuing struggle by filmmakers
	  and the production of a number of fine films, these problems remain. The new
	  generation filmmakers are still generally tied to Film Festivals and still dependent
	  on external production finance. Work on video and digital video is providing
	  alternatives, but it is not clear how far they can challenge the dominance of
	  western controlled distribution and exhibition.</p>

	  </p>
	  <p>Ousmane Sembène is generally acknowledged as both a founding figure and
        outstanding practitioner in Sub-Saharan African cinema. Semb&egrave;ne&#8217;s
        importance flows from a variety of influences and circumstances. He is
        an established writer, and just as he has fought to make films in African
        languages and cultural forms, so his writing has aimed at an African
        expression. His novel Ceddo, later filmed, was the first book written
        in Wolof, the indigenous language in Senegal. It is also clear that his
        experiences have fed into his art. His service in the French military
        in the Second World War relates directly to his film Camp De Thiaroye.
        His industrial experience, especially in the Marseilles docks, fed into
        his early writings. And the experience of European colonialism and racism
        in all these areas has fed into his politics, which have a Marxist understanding
        of classes and the state, and awareness, like Fanon, of the particularities
        of racism.</p>

	  <p>Sembène has made only ten feature films in 40 years. Xala is the fifth
        of these, and the only one generally accessible in the UK. He coined
        the term m&eacute;gotage.</p>
		<p class="quote">&quot;...the word m&eacute;got means cigarette butt; therefore, the concept means
      to make a film by the painful process of putting bits and pieces together.
      It means waiting - as one waits for a cigarette butt - for European remains
      such as film stock left over by rich producers. This is why it takes five
      to ten years to finish a film ... &quot;</p>

		<p>(FESTIVAL PANAFRICAIN DU CIN&Eacute;MA A OUAGADOUGOU)</p>
		<p>African films quickly established a reputation at European and North
        American Festivals for 'art' films. The most noted directors were frequent
        winners of awards. And this success helped open up production finance from western
        companies. But neither aspect helped the artists reach their own indigenous
		African audiences.</p>
		<p>One arena where this has been achieved is in the Film Festivals based in
        Africa. The two longest running and most important are:</p>
		<p>Journ&eacute;es Cin&eacute;matographiques de Carthage.</p>
		<p>The Tunisian Minister of Cultural Affairs created this in 1966. The programmes
        do include Western films but the emphasis is on films from Arabia and
        Sub-Saharan Africa. So, in 1966, Semb&egrave;ne's first feature length
        film, Le Noire de ... won the Tanit 'd'or award. The Festival also includes
        symposia and public debates. These were important arenas for the early discussions
        that led to FEPACI.</p>
		<p>Festival Panafricain du Cin&eacute;ma de Ouagadougou.</p>
		<p>This began in 1968 organised by the Ministry of Information. From its inception
        the emphasis has been ideological:</p>
		<p>&quot;Contrary to what the name suggests, the festivals are less a festivity
        than a militant reunion.&quot; Thus, there are regular debates and forums,
        and it has providing a regular forum for FEPACI. With the development of
        FESPACO, it and the JCC became bi-annual, alternating in consecutive years.
        Ouagadougou has also developed as a joint Film and Television festival.
        Semb&egrave;ne's Camp de Thiaroye won the Prix Institut des Peuples Noirs
    	at the Festival in 1989.</p>

	  	<p>Sembène Ousmane is an established writer, and just as he has fought to
	   make films in African languages and cultural forms, so his writing has aimed
	   at an African expression. The experience of European colonialism and racism
	   has fed into his politics, which have a Marxist understanding of classes
	   and the state, and an awareness, like Fanon, of the particularities of racism.
	   These are central to his 1974 film, Xala, which is his only film available
	   on video in the UK. The film centres on the problems of a trader and member
	   of the Chamber of Commerce, El Hadji. Taking a third and much younger wife,
	   [as allowed under Islamic law] El Hadji&#8217;s pleasures are frustrated
	   by impotence, apparently the result of a curse. The films follows his increasingly
	   desperate efforts to reverse the curse, which also undermines his social
	   and business position.</p>
	   <p>He, and the Chamber of Commerce, are depicted as subservient to foreign
	   capital. Thus the continual framing of Dupont-Durand [the representative
	   of the neo-colonial economic power] in the frame behind the president. [the
	   hand behind the throne]. Xala in the film refers not only to El Hadji's lack
	   of potency in the sexual arena, but also to the lack of potency of his class
	   in the economic field. They buy, sell, cheat and swindle, but they cannot
	   exploit on the level of the neo-colonialists.</p>
	   <p>In Xala, the contrast between El Hadji&#8217;s three wives is important.
	   Fran&ccedil;oise Pfaff interviewed Sembène in 1984; he commented,</p>
	   <p class="quote">&quot;He [El Hadji] married his first wife before he became somebody. Having
	   improved his economic and social status, he takes a second wife [Oumi], who,
	   so to speak, parallels the second historical stage of his life. His third
	   wife [N&#8217;Gone], who is his daughter's age but without her mentality,
	   is only there for self-satisfaction.&quot;</p>
	   <p class="quote">His daughter, Rama, on the other hand, is</p>
	   <p class="quote">&quot;...aggressive and assertive as N'Gone is passive and submissive. She is as
	   articulate in her speech pattern as N'Gone is silent. As an unmarried student
	   with intellectual potential and as a young militant for Africanization. Rama
	   often defies her father by speaking Wolof, knowing that he prefers to use
	   French. ... Sembène visually stresses her independence of mind as well as
	   her freedom as a character by presenting her alone in many more shots than
	   the other female characters.&quot;</p>
	   <br>
	   <p>The women are central to the problem of the narrative, and to the various
	   symbols that add meanings. A key signifier is the map of Africa, seen behind
	   Rama as she defies her father, he himself fronting a map of Africa broken
	   up and partitioned by colonial boundaries. These portrayals of women are
	   expressive of the ant-colonial ideology of Fanon. These films do actually
	   position women within the revolution, and they also raise the contradictory
	   position of women.</p>
	   <p>Sembène use of the type of production approach developed in neo-realism is clearly, in part, a product of circumstances.
	   Foremost, he privileges African linguistic and stylistic traditions.
	   Hence the use or non-use of Wolof is central to the development of the narrative.
	   Whilst El Hadji is neither redeemed nor converted by the end of the film,
	   his attempt to speak in Wolof at the Chamber of Commerce is both highly poetic
	   and metaphoric. Similarly African or European clothes and accessories provide
	   a continuing commentary on the characters.</p>
	   <p>It is clearly a factor of the circumstances that Sembène uses the production
	   approach pioneered by neorealism. He also favours the use of non-professionals
	   to a degree in the film and of actual locations. Many sequences share the
	   same rough and impromptu feel found in neorealism. However, there is also
	   a powerful overall formal control. Sembène uses variations on the ideas of
	   Sergei Eisenstein on montage and film rhetoric. The mental flashbacks by
	   El Hadji of a sexual humiliation are clearly montage editing. But Sembène
	   is more inclined to use montage in the wider sense, both visually and aurally.
	   The elliptical development of the narrative is thus modelled on Eisenstein's
	   wider categories of montage. The editing together of scenes, especially the
	   short scenes as with a robbery, produces a constant clash of characters and
	   ideas. Sembène re-inforces this by using the type of rhetoric favoured by
	   Eisenstein: clothing and objects both represent characters traits and functions
	   and comment upon these. Thus the ubiquitous briefcases in the Chamber of
	   Commerce are a shorthand symbol for the corrupt bourgeoisie. Among the counter-Africanist
	   symbols is the map that frames Rama in her dispute with her father.</p>
	   <p>In the UK the songs in the film are not rendered with sub-titles:</p>
	   <div class="quote">
	   <p>Ghali: There are many songs in the film's soundtrack which have not been
	   sub-titled. What do they say?</p>
	   <p>Sembène: It's a sort of popular song that I wrote myself in Wolof In one
	   sense, it calls to revolt, to the struggle against injustice, against the
	   powers-that-be, against the leaders of today who, if we do not get rid of
	   them, will tomorrow be trees which are going to overrun the place and have
	   to be cut down. The songs are tied in with the deeds and gestures that I
	   have written. They did not come from folklore. I had thought at the start
	   to have them translated, but in the end I gave up the idea because it is
	   unnecessary for a European public.</p>
	   <p>It is the allegory of a kind of lizard, a lizard who is a bad leader.
	   When he walks in front and you behind, he kills you while saying you want
	   to murder him. When you walk as tall as he does, he kills you while saying: &quot;You
	   want to be my equal.&quot; When you walk in front of him he kills you while
	   saying: &quot;You want to profit from my good luck.&quot; The song says we
	   have to think very seriously indeed about these leaders who resemble this
	   animal and get rid of them. It ends something like this: &quot;Glory to the
	   people, to the people's rule, to the people's government, which will not
	   be government by a single individual!&quot;</p></div>
