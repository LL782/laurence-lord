	  <p>Contemporary African societies are still objectively undergoing an experience
of domination exerted on a number of levels: political, economic and cultural.
Cultural domination, which is all the more dangerous for being insidious, imposes
on our peoples models of behavior and systems of values whose essential function
is to buttress the ideological and economic ascendancy of the imperialist powers.
The main channels open to this form of control are supplied by the new technologies
of communication: books, the audio-visual, and very specifically the cinema…</p>

<p>To assume a genuinely active role in the process of development, African culture
must be popular, democratic and progressive in character, inspired by its own
realities and responding to its own needs. It must also be in solidarity with
cultural struggles all over the world.</p>

<p>In this context, African filmmakers must be in solidarity with progressive filmmakers
who are waging anti-imperialist struggles throughout the world. Moreover, the
question of commercial profit can be no yardstick for African filmmakers. The
only relevant criterion of profitability is the knowledge of whether the needs
and aspirations of the people are expressed, and not those of specific interest
groups. This means that all the structural problems of their national cinema
must be of paramount importance to African filmmakers.</p>
