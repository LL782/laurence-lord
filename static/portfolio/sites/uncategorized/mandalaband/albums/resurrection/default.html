David played keyboards and contributed to the backing vocals – and engineered, produced and composed the music.</p>          <p>With this new mix, David has been able to reinforce the sound of the instruments to give more power and depth to the original recordings. As a result, 35 years on, a veil of sonic mist has been lifted from these unique recordings. The rhythm section, synth orchestration and lead vocals possess a clarity never heard before, making this edition of Mandalaband I an audio treasure. Allow the 20-minute opus that is ‘Om Mani Padme Hum’ to wash over you, with its strident keyboards, soaring guitars, rich tenor vocal and supporting choir. <strong>Dave Durant</strong> and the <strong>London Chorale</strong> perform mantras and lyrics from the Tibetan national anthem in this <strong>symphonic rock masterpiece</strong> which so impressed DJs John Peel and Alan Freeman. We know you will enjoy this new version as much as those pioneer promoters of Prog Rock.</p>          <p>The bonus tracks on Mandalaband I consist of (9) the original demo of Om Mani Padme Hum (1st Movement) recorded at Camel Studios (8-track) in Poynton, Cheshire; (10) a live version of Looking In performed at CBS Studios, in front of Chris Wright (Chairman of Chrysalis); and (11) the Indigo Sound recording of Roof of the World, made after the Wessex Studios album version. All three tracks are sourced from 7.5 ips stereo analogue quarter-inch copy tapes in David’s archive – the original multi-tracks of (9) and (11) having been lost and (10) only ever being recorded directly onto a stereo tape machine. As a result, there has been no opportunity to re-mix them and they remain as they were originally mastered. </p>         </div>       </div>      <div class="end01">    <a class="top01" href="#top">Top</a>   </div>      <div>       <img style="float:right; margin-right:36px; margin-top: 3em;" src="../../img/decorations/cover-358-wendor.jpg" width="359" height="442" />        <div style="margin: 0 36px;">         <h4>CD 2: MANDALABAND II</h4>     <h4>The Eye of Wendor</h4>          <ol id="tracklist01" style="margin-left: 20px;">      <li>The Eye of Wendor (Overture)<span>4:47</span></li>      <li>Florian’s Song<span>3:05</span></li>      <li>Ride to the City<span>2:54</span></li>      <li>Almar’s Tower<span>1:57</span></li>      <li>Like the Wind<span>2:52</span></li>      <li>The Tempest<span>1:12</span></li>      <li>Dawn of a New Day<span>4:05</span></li>      <li>Departure from Carthilias<span>3:07</span></li>      <li>Elsethea<span>2:46</span></li>      <li>The Witch of Waldow Wood<span>4:36</span></li>      <li>Silesandre<span>3:21</span></li>      <li>Aenord’s Lament<span>1:52</span></li>      <li>Funeral of the King<span>1:28</span></li>      <li>Coronation of Damien<span>2:23</span></li>            <span class="midLista" style="display: block; margin: 2em 0 25px -40px; text-transform:uppercase; color: #0d95f0; padding: 0;">Bonus Tracks</span>            <li>The Eye of Wendor (Indigo)<span>4:32</span></li>      <li>The Witch of Waldow Wood (Indigo)<span>4:38</span></li>      <li>Silesandre (Indigo)<span>3:24</span></li>     </ol>         </div>        <div style="clear: both; margin: 40px 36px;">         <p>Over the years The Eye of Wendor has attained cult status amongst Prog Rock fans all over the world. David has completely remixed and remastered the album and now the sheer quality of the production and recording can be appreciated with a new clarity and depth. The complex counter rhythms and melodies which made Wendor such a special album are here revealed as they were originally heard in the studio during those halcyon days in the late 1970s. Based on a Tolkienesque fantasy centred around a magical gemstone, vocalists <strong>Eric Stewart</strong> (10cc), <strong>Maddy Prior</strong> (Steeleye Span), <strong>Justin Hayward</strong> (Moody Blues), <strong>Graham Gouldman, Lol Creme &amp; Kevin Godley</strong> (10cc) and <strong>Paul Young</strong> (Sad Café/ Mike and the Mechanics) tell the tale.</p>          <p>Other contributors include:<strong> Ritchie Close</strong> (Grand Piano, Piano &amp; Fender Rhodes); <strong>Woolly Wolstenholme</strong> (Mellotrons &amp; Synths, Moog Horns, Cathedral and Hammond Organs); <strong>David Rohl</strong> (Grand Piano, Pianos &amp; Synths); <strong>Phil Chapman</strong> (Flutes, Fifes, Alto &amp; Tenor Saxophones); <strong>Steve Broomhead</strong> (Lead, Spanish, Electric &amp; Acoustic Guitars); <strong>John Lees</strong> (Lead Guitar, Guitars); <strong>Ashley Mulford</strong> (Lead Guitar, Guitars); <strong>Jimmy McDonnell</strong> (Guitar, Rhythm Guitar); <strong>Norman Barratt</strong> (Voice Box Guitar); <strong>Les Holroyd</strong> (Bass); <strong>Noel Redding</strong> (Bass); <strong>Pete Glennon</strong> (Bass); <strong>Graham Gouldman </strong>(Bass); <strong>Alf Tramontin</strong> (Bass); <strong>Kim Turner</strong> (Drums, Percussion, Synths, Acoustic Guitar); <strong>David Hassle</strong> (Drums, Percussion); <strong>Mel Pritchard</strong> (Drums, Rototoms); the <strong>Gerald Brown Singers </strong>and the <strong>Halle Orchestra</strong> Strings.<strong></strong></p>          <p>The&nbsp; original Eye of Wendor took two full years to create, beginning in the autumn of 1976 at Strawberry Studios in Stockport, England, where David Rohl had recently been appointed Chief Engineer. With the help of Barclay James Harvest (David was engineering and coproducing them at the time) plus musician friends and colleagues with whom he had worked over the years, the Mandalaband founder carefully created this classic symphonic rock album on a budget of just £8,000. All the singers and musicians contributed their talents for free, working in the studio ‘dead hours’ to keep costs down and so as to afford the luxury of the Hallé Orchestra and Gerald Brown Singers – the final icing on the cake of this ambitious project.</p>          <p>All Eye of Wendor titles have been re-mixed from the original 24-track tapes, with the exception of the Strawberry recordings of (1) The Eye of Wendor (Overture), (10) The Witch of Waldow Wood and (11) Silesandre.&nbsp; These titles were all recorded on a 24-track master tape which has subsequently been lost. The three tracks were therefore digitally re-mastered from the original stereo analogue masters.</p>          <p>The bonus tracks on this CD are 16-track demos of (15) The Eye of Wendor, (16) The Witch of Waldow Wood and (17) Silesandre, recorded at Indigo Sound in 1975.</p>         </div>       </div>      <div id="licence">       <p>All original recordings (CD 1: tracks 1-8 and CD 2: tracks 1-11) are issued under licence from EMI Records Ltd.<br />All bonus tracks (CD&nbsp;1:&nbsp;tracks 9-11 and CD 2: tracks 12-14) are owned by Legend Records.</p>        <p>Mandalaband I - All music and lyrics published by Go Music/Island Music Ltd.
