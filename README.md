1.  **I don't want to worry too much**

    For years I've overthought what others will think of my website

    Then I had a thought that I found liberating

    > This I write for myself not for an audience

2.  **Tech stack**

    I'm starting out with a Gatsby site

    **https://www.gatsbyjs.com/**

3.  **Open source. Sure why not**

    I'm not showing off but I'm not hiding anything

    You can clone the repo, `npm i`, `npm run develop` and have this running at http://localhost:8000
