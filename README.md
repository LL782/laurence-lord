# Laurence Lord - Creative Developer

üëã Welcome to the repo for my personal website 

üëâ [`laurencelord.co.uk`](https://www.laurencelord.co.uk)

## üöÄ üåù About this!

1.  **Be yourself ü§ô**

    For years I've overthought what others will think of my website ü§î

    Then I had a thought that I found liberating...

    > This I write for myself, not for an audience

2.  **Tech stack: _Convenient üì±_**

    I'm using [`Gatsby`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and MDX (JSX enriched markdown) to make editing quick and easy

    I can edit content and redeploy it from the browser on my phone (which is nice)

3.  **Open source. _Sure, why not?_ ü§ó**

    I'm not showing off but I'm not hiding anything

    You can clone the repo, `npm i`, `npm run develop` and have this running at http://localhost:8000
    
    Or you can just dip in and steal the code you like. No worries
